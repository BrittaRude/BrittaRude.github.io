title: "Innovations in the Space of Learning and Social Interaction (with Anna Arias-Duart and Chelsea Couture)"
date: 2022-11-10
myexcerpt: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in virtual work and learning environments. The paper at hand sheds light on how social interactions are affected in the virtual space. We focus on one specific sub-area of virtual interactions in adult professional development programs: The virtual learning environment offered to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) staff members. This study applies a qualitative research strategy and conducts
semi-structured interviews with 3 different target groups. The investigation found that all 3 stakeholder groups coincide on certain advantages and disadvantages when learning online, and that the creation of meaningful social relationships virtually is especially problematic. The current investigation concludes by giving 3 higher-level recommendations on how to foster social interactions in the virtual space and relates these to specified hands-on approaches.
