title: "Poverty Maps in El Salvador (with Monica Robayo-Abril)"
date: 2022-11-11
myexcerpt: This report presents poverty maps at the municipality level based on the Fay-Herriot model for small-area estimations. Direct estimates of poverty indicators at the municipality level rely on information generated from household surveys. Often, though, household surveys are not representative at disaggregated levels, such as municipalities. Consequently, small sample sizes limit their precision and estimates cannot be obtained for out-of-sample domains. Due to this, we resort to small-area estimation techniques, which rely on several data sources to improve the precision of survey-based direct estimates. For the case of El Salvador, we use data from the last available Population Census conducted in 2007 and the 2019 household survey (Encuesta de Hogares de Propositos Multiples, EHPM). We also draw from population projections at the municipality level, as El Salvador is subject to high emigration rates. Many methodologies for poverty mapping require that reference years of the data sources used as a basis for small area estimations are as close to each other as possible. Due to the fact that the last available census is from 2007, we decided to use small area estimation techniques based on the Fay-Herriot model, which is the most appropriate model in this case.
