title: "Middle-run Impacts of Comprehensive Early Childhood Interventions: Evidence from a Pioneer Program in Chile"
date: 2022-11-15
myexcerpt: This paper analyzes the impact of comprehensive and universal early childhood development programs on outcomes in middle childhood. I exploit the birth eligibility cutoff of a pioneer intervention of this type in Chile and use administrative data on grade point averages, standardized test scores, and an extensive early childhood development survey. *(Published in Journal of Population Economics)*
