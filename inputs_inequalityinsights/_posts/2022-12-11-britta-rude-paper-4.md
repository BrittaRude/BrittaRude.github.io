title: "Quantifying vulnerability to poverty in El Salvador (with Monica Robayo-Abril)"
date: 2022-11-12
myexcerpt: El Salvador is marked by high vulnerability to risks and hazards, such as crime, natural disasters, and migration. It is, therefore, crucial to understand the vulnerability patterns of its population. We apply an innovative approach to estimate the population's vulnerability to poverty and analyze its underlying drivers. We find that ex-ante vulnerability to poverty has decreased over the period 2016-2019, a parallel trend to the poverty reduction observed in the country during this period. This finding comes hand in hand with an increase in the importance of risk-factors relative to a low accumulation of assets driving vulnerability. Additionally, household-level shocks play a more significant role than community-level shocks. In order to address vulnerabilities in the country, the government should invest in adaptive safety nets and risk mitigation strategies.
