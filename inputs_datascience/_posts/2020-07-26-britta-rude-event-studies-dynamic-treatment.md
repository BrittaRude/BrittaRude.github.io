## Event Studies - Application to dynamic events 

In my [previous blogpost](https://brittarude.github.io/blog/2020/07/23/britta-rude-event-studies-and-their-flaws), I have summarized some research about the flaws of event studies. But can we apply our event study design to settings in which treatments happen at different points in time across units? This is exactly what [Sun and Abraham (2020)](http://economics.mit.edu/files/14964) discuss in their working paper. They show that in these kind of settings, the estimate of a given coefficient can be contaminated by the effect from other periods. Therefore, apparent pre-trends can arise from the sole effect of contamination and treatment effect heterogeneity. They derive an alternative estimator, that is free of this contamination. 

They follow
