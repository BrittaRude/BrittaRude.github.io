## Staggered Difference-in-Difference: What does it mean?

Often, a policy is introduced in many different states during many different time periods. This is what researchers refer to when they talk about a staggered Difference-in-Difference Design, or a generalized Difference-in-Difference. Let's have a look at the food stamp program. The food stamp program was rolled out on a county-by-county basis between 1962 and 1975. The program provided low-income families with food vouchers that could be used at grocery stores. A paper by [Hoynes et al. (2016)](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130375) uses this _staggered_ roll-out as their identification strategy to assess the long-run effects of childhood access to the safety net. They analyze the participation in the program, and with this, an increase in income and resources, on health and economic outcomes in the long-run. Their main treatment variable is the time period that children were subject to the program between conception and the age of 5.
