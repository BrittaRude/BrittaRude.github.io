	<p><b>Hi there, Welcome to my Page!</b><p>
	
	<p>My name is Britta Rude. I'm a Junior Economist at [iFO Institute](https://www.ifo.de/en) and a Consultant at the [Poverty and Equity Global Practice](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty) of the World Bank. I hold a PhD in Economics from the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (2023). I am also a graduate of the [Regional Academy on the United Nations](http://www.ra-un.org/) 2021, together with UNHCR, and a research member of [PILLARS](https://www.h2020-pillars.eu/). Previously, I was a Consultant at the Education Global Practice and the Environment & Natural Resources Global Practice of the World Bank. <p> 
		
	<p> Here I want to share what I am most passionate about, that is, topics of inequality, as well as data science. This website is about the reasons and consequences of inequality, and about how data science can help to better understand and address it. How can we secure that everybody gets a piece of the cake, and how can we make the cake as big as possible? How can we use data science to achieve what's most important, a decent life for everybody?<p>
