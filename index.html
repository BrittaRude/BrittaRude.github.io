	<p><b>Hi there, Welcome to my Page!</b><p>
	
	<p>My name is Britta Rude. I'm a PhD student in Economics at LMU , a Junior Economist at iFO Institute , and a Consultant at The World Bank. I am a graduate of the Regional Academy on the United Nations 2021, together with UNHCR. Here I want to share what I am most passionate about, that is, topics of inequality, as well as data science.<p> 
		
	<p>This website is about the reasons and consequences of inequality, and about how data science can help to better understand and address it. How can we secure that everybody gets a piece of the cake, and how can we make the cake as big as possible? How can we use data science to achieve what's most important, a decent life for everybody?<p>
