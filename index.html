	<p><b>Hi there, Welcome to my Page!</b><p>
	
	<p>My name is Britta Rude. I'm an Economist at the World Bank's Young Professional Program in the Poverty and Equity Global Practice (South Asia). I hold a PhD in Economics from Ludwig-Maximilian-University Munich (2023). Previously, I was a Consultant at the Poverty and Equity Global Practice, the Education Global Practice, and the Environment & Natural Resources Global Practice of the World Bank. I have supported several teams in their analytical and operational work in Europe and Central Asia (ECA), Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and South Asia (SAR). I am also a graduate of the Regional Academy on the United Nations 2021, together with UNHCR, and a research member of PILLARS (financed by the European Union). I have four years of work experience as a Junior Economist at the ifo Institut. <p> 
		
	<p> Here I want to share what I am most passionate about, that is, topics of inequality, as well as data science. This website is about the reasons and consequences of inequality, and about how data science can help to better understand and address it. How can we secure that everybody gets a piece of the cake, and how can we make the cake as big as possible? How can we use data science to achieve what's most important, a decent life for everybody?<p>
