	<h1>Hi there, I'm Britta Rude!</h1>
	<p>I'm a PhD student in economics at LMU , a Junior Economist at iFO Institute , and a Consultant at the World Bank. Here I want to share what I am most passionate about, that is, topics of inequality, as well as data science.<p> 
		
	<p>This website is about the reasons and consequences of inequality, and about how data science can help to better understand and address it. How can we secure that everybody get's a piece of the cake, and how can we make the cake as big as possible? How can we use data science to achieve what's most important, a decent life for everybody?<p>
