## The oldest story of human kind, and also, just a story about a cake - What is inequality to me? 

Economists love to tell a story about a cake, when they are asked about inequality. It is a simple, but powerful concept. Imagine it's your grand-uncles birthday again, and you and your entire family is invited. Your mum has baked her famous, delicious apricot cake again, and everybody has been graving it for the last year. But then there are your three hungry brothers arriving directly from their soccer game. It is very simple. They could eat the entire cake by themselves, or they could just hold back and let your mum distribute the cake more or less equally between all of you - maybe your grand-uncle will get an extra large piece. What's the story that will be told?

This concept is easily applicable to a lot of real world examples about inequality. Let's have a look at Paraguay, for example. Paraguay is one of the most unequal countries in the world in terms of land ownership. It has XX hectares, but XX are owned by XX percent of its population. What about the rest of the Paraguayan population? Well, one could say that they just did not get a piece of the cake. Land ownership, on the other hand, has important implications on wealth and income. Often times, you cannot apply to a credit without land ownership, for example. You cannot make productive use out of land if you do not own it, without having to pay a fee for it. You cannot rent out your land. You cannot use it as an asset, or risk diversification. You cannot inheritate it to your children. But if you cannot access a credit, then you might not have access to liquidity. And you might not be able to invest in machinery needed to make productive use of the land of somebody else. And you will have to pay a rent for this other person's land. Also, you cannot decide freely for how long, and for which purpose to use this piece of land that is just not your owns. The story goes on and on... 

Of course, it is much more complex than that, but it gives a pretty well understanding of what is going on when we think about inequality. Inequality is complex, difficult to understand. It is structural, systematic and often difficult to disentangle.
