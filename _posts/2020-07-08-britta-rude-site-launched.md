#The oldest story of human cake, and also, just the story about a cake - What is inequality to me? 

Economists love to tell a story about a cake, when they are asked about inequality. It is a simple, but powerful concept. Imagine it's your grand-uncles birthday again, and you and your entire family is invited. Your mum has baked her famous, delicious apricot cake again, and everybody has been graving it for the last year. But then there are your three hungry brothers arriving directly from their soccer game. It is very simple. They could eat the entire cake by themselves, or they could just hold back and let your mum distribute the cake more or less equally between all of you - maybe your grand-uncle will get an extra large piece. What's the story that will be told?

This concept is easily applicable to a lot of real world examples about inequality. Let's have a look at Paraguay, for example. Paraguay is one of the most unequal countries in the world in terms of land ownership. It has XX hectares, but XX are owned by XX percent of its population.
