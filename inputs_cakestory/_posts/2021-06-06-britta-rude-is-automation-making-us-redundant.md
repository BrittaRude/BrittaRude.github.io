title: "Is automation making us redundant?"
date: 2021-05-30
myexcerpt: The industry 4.0 transformation consists of several technological advances, reaching from robotics, over IT and digitisation, to artificial intelligence and machine learning. One thing that all have in common is automation. Is the automation of human tasks making us redundant?

# What is automation? 

The [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/automation) defines automation as "the use of machines and computers that can operate without needing human control". Other definitions, as the one by the [International Society of Automation](https://www.isa.org/about-isa/what-is-automation), go one step further and define automation as "the creation and application of technology to monitor and control the production and delivery of products and services". This means that automation is not only about machines or computers, but is more of a process, which involves everybody involved in the creation of a certain type of technology. [Techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32099/automation) aknowledges that automation involves minimal human intervention, but that it also creates new jobs and increases productivity. So, are we becoming redundant, as machines and computers increasingly conduct human tasks? 

# Tasks versus skills - and why the conceptual difference is important when talking automation

Influential work by Autor, Levy and Murnane (ALM) from MIT revolutionized the way economists analyzed the way we look at skill demand ([Autor, Levy and Murnane (2003)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/11600)). Earlier work defined skills as the average education level of workers in a given occupation. ALM (2003) broke up this definition to introducing a distinction between skills and tasks. Here, a task is "a unit of work activity that produces output" while a skill is "a workerâ€™sstockof capabilities for performing various task".
