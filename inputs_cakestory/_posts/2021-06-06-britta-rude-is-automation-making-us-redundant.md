# What is automation? 

The [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/automation) defines automation as "the use of machines and computers that can operate without needing human control". Other definitions, as the one by th [International Society of Automation](https://www.isa.org/about-isa/what-is-automation) go one step further and define automation as the "the creation and application of technology to monitor and control the production and delivery of products and services". This means that automation is not only about machines or computers, but is more of a process, which involves everybody involved in the creation of a certain type of technology.
