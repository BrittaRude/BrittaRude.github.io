## Act 1: To address a problem, we need to know what is going on. 

In 2006, Chile finds out that an overproportional large share of its children younger than 4 years old is affected by poverty (CASEN (2006)). 10.5 percent of the overall population live below the poverty line, and 3.2 percent in extreme poverty, compared to 16.7 percent of children below 4 years old (7.2 percent respectively). At the same time, the National Survey of Quality of Life conducted in 2006 revealed that 30 percent of children below 5 years old did not reach their development goals, and that development delays mainly persisted in low income groups. 

These findings caused resonance in the political debate, and shortly thereafter, the Presidential Advisory Council for the Reform of Policies for Children was founded. Its purpose was to identify, formulate and design the establishment of a social protections system for Early Childhood in Chile.
