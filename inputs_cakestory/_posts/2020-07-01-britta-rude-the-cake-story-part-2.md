## Act 1: To address a problem, we need to know what is going on. 

In 2006, Chile finds out that an overproportional large share of its children younger than 4 years old is affected by poverty (CASEN (2006)). 10.5 percent of the overall population live below the poverty line, and 3.2 percent in extreme poverty, compared to 16.7 percent of children below 4 years old (7.2 percent respectively). At the same time, the National Survey of Quality of Life conducted in 2006 revealed that 30 percent of children below 5 years old did not reach their development goals, and that development delays mainly persisted in low income groups. These findings caused resonance in the political debate, and shortly thereafter, the Presidential Advisory Council for the Reform of Policies for Children was founded. Its purpose was to identify, formulate and design the establishment of a social protections system for Early Childhood in Chile, today known as Chile Crece Contigo. 

This is one example showing how data helped to reveal a problem, then resulting in a targeted response. To make things better, we need to know what is going on. Another example is the High/Scope Perry Preschool Project. The High/Scope Perry Preschool Project started in 1962 analyzing the influences of pre-school education on children's learning outcomes. The project started when David Weikert noted that poor children do much worse in school, and founded a committee trying to address this. As part of the project, a random group of vulnerable, ultra-poor children between 3 and 4 years old got access to pre-school as well as a weekly 90-minute home visit by a social worker, while a second group of vulnerable, ultra-poor children with similar characteristics served as their control group. 24 years later, researchers compared several socio-economic outcomes among both groups, as criminal activities, income, and educational outcomes. The relevations of the High/Scope Perry Preschool Project contributed to the general acceptance of the importance of kindergardens in society, and the foundation of a large number of pre-school facilities. Nowadays, the High/Scope Perry Preschool Project has been extensively studied, similar initiatives have been founded, and the knowledge created through data generated through these experiments, flows into respective policy designs.
