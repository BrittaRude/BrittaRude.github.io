# What is inequality? 

Often we hear that inequality is bad for us. That it affects our possibility to grow, that it creates social frictions and unrest, and that it violates human rights. Let's take the social unrests of 2019 that marked Latin America. People took the streets continuously in Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela, from the Carribean down to Patagonia, to protest about their living conditions and demonstrate their dissatisfaction with local authorities and governance. It was declared the region's strongest uptake for the last decades. It lead to the accusation of ex-president Evo Morales of terrorism and him fleeing to excil, the declaration of the State of Emergency in Santiago de Chile  and 3,746 being wounded and 26 dead in the entire country of Chile, and damages of 1.4 billion US dollars due to destruction, looting and decreased sales ([Source](https://reliefweb.int/report/chile/chile-civil-unrest-dref-final-report-mdrcl014)). It resulted in the president of Peru dissolving congress, and a violent response by the Maduro government in Venezuela as a response to mass demonstration against its leadership, during which children got hurt and murdered ([Source](https://www.hrw.org/es/news/2019/05/03/venezuela-violenta-respuesta-las-manifestaciones)).

These are not the only events that relate to inequality. One such event was the Arab Spring that took place nearly a decade ago, and which was a pro-democratic movement in several large Muslim countries, as Tunisia, Morocco, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Bahrain, seeking increased social freedoms and greater participation in the political process. And, not so long ago Europe saw itself subject to a large refugee crisis. On December 7 of 2015 more than 911,000 refugees and migrants had arrived on European ([Source](https://www.unhcr.org/news/stories/2015/12/56ec1ebde/2015-year-europes-refugee-crisis.html)). 

These are only some of the consequences that inequality creates. But what is inequality exactly, and how does it evolve?
