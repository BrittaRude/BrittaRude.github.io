The trends in robotization are unreversable by now. Figure X shows the number of robot installations per 1,000 employed people by geographic regions. The number of robot installations per year have spiked over time, but certain regions are leading this increase while others fall behind. Robotization is mainly concentrated in the manufacturing sector as can be seen in ... but other sectors have picked up on robotization. Figure X shows that the manufacturing sector play an important role in the East Asia & Pacific region where it makes up for 22.8 percent of GDP. It only accounts for 10.7 percent of GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa.
