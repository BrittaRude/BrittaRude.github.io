title: "Are robots grabbing our jobs - and what are they doing to inequality?"
date: 2021-05-30
myexcerpt: Robotization is unstoppable by now. It is still unclear how these technological improvements will affect labor markets, and especially the poor. Are they a potential to reduce inequality - or a threat further exacerbating already existing gaps?

## The rise of the machines - Are Science Fiction movies becoming true?

The trends in robotization are unreversable by now. Figure X shows the number of robot installations per 1,000 employed people by geographic regions. The number of robot installations per year have spiked over time, but certain regions are leading this increase while others fall behind. Robotization is mainly concentrated in the manufacturing sector as can be seen in ... but other sectors have picked up on robotization. Figure X shows that the manufacturing sector plays an important role in the East Asia & Pacific region where it makes up for 22.8 percent of GDP. It only accounts for 10.7 percent of GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Recent evidence from the US shows that robots have negative effects on wages and employmnent [Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/19696). The researchers at MIT and Boston University explore the labor market effects of an increased exposure to robots at the commuting-zone level. This is based on the fact that, according to the authors, robots and workers compete on the labor market and that robots potentially displace some of the human workforce (a phenomenon they call the displacement effect). The authors find sizable effects, namely that an increase of 1 robot per 1,000 workers from 1993 to 2007 recuded wages by nearly 1 percent and the employment-to-population ratio by nearly 0.39 percentage points, relative to a commuting-zone without robots. This means that one new robot decreases employment by 6 workers. 
But robotization does not only have negative effects. It leads to productivity increases and decreases in prices of those goods produced by robots [Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/19696). When taking account of these positive side effects, the overall effect of robotization is still negative but by much less. In this case one new robot decreases employment by 3.3 workers.  

So what about inequality? [Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/19696) find that certain groups are more affected by robots than others. Specifically, effects are more marked for the manufacturing sector and those industries which concentrate a larger number of robots. Additionally, the effects are more pronounced for workers conducting routine manual jobs as well as blue-collar workers. The researchers also look at the effects by education group and find negative impacts on all workers, independently of their educations status. Still, when looking at the wage distribution, they show that those earning less than the average are the ones most affected by the wage decrease. The fact that robot adoption does not result in positive impacts for the high-skilled means that robots are not complementary to their tasks and increase their productivity (as is the case in other forms of technological change, as for example in the IT sector). 

On the contrary, research by [Feng an Graetz](https://academic-oup-com.emedien.ub.uni-muenchen.de/ej/article/130/631/2249/5831197) find that automation leads to job polarization. This means that low-skilled and high-skilled workers are unaffected by automation, and that it is the middle-skilled experiencing most of the negative impacts. Consequently, wages increase both in the low-wage employment as well as high-wage employment. They show that this is driven by firms' decision making. When confronted with two tasks that are equally automatable, firms tend to automate the one that requires more training over the one characterized by a higher engineering complexity.

A recent paper conducting analysis using firm-level data from France comes to very different results than the ones found for the US. In contrast to Acemglu and Restrepo (2020) the authors of [What Are the Labor and Product Market Effects of Automation?New Evidence from France](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/aghion/files/what_are_the_labor_and_product_market_effects_of_automation_jan2020.pdf) find that automation leads to an increased labor demand, higher profits, lower consumer prices and higher sales. It therefore has an overall positive effect. Employment effects are even positive for unskilled industrial workers. This could be an indicator for the productivity effect (an increase in productivity driven by robotization) outweighting the displacement effect (robots substituting for workers) [Aghion et al (2020)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/aghion/files/what_are_the_labor_and_product_market_effects_of_automation_jan2020.pdf). Consequently, in a globalized world, in which robotization is unstoppable by now, it might be damaging to introduce protective mechanisms aiming at securing employment against robots. Firms placed in countries without those mechanisms might outperform those placed in protected economies through the induced productivity gains. Additionally, in the case of France, there are no significant effects of robot adoption on inequalitiy. 

## Transformers - What about the developing world? 

The pioneer paper by [Graetz and Michaels (2018)](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article/100/5/753/58489/Robots-at-Work) looks at robotization in different industries and 17 different countries from 1993 to 2007. They find that, overall, an increase in robot adoption leads to an increase in overall productivity as well as wages and a decrease in prices. Still, it has negative employment effects on the low-skilled.
