title: "Are robots grabbing our jobs - and what are they doing to inequality?"
date: 2021-05-30
myexcerpt: Robotization is unstoppable by now. It is still unclear how these technological improvements will affect labor markets, and especially the poor. Are they a potential to reduce inequality - or a threat further exacerbating already existing gaps?

## The rise of the machines - Are Science Fiction movies becoming true?

The trends in robotization are unreversable by now. Figure X shows the number of robot installations per 1,000 employed people by geographic regions. The number of robot installations per year have spiked over time, but certain regions are leading this increase while others fall behind. Robotization is mainly concentrated in the manufacturing sector as can be seen in ... but other sectors have picked up on robotization. Figure X shows that the manufacturing sector plays an important role in the East Asia & Pacific region where it makes up for 22.8 percent of GDP. It only accounts for 10.7 percent of GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Recent evidence from the US shows that robots have negative effects on wages and employmnent [Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/19696). The researchers at MIT and Boston University explore the labor market effects of an increased exposure to robots at the commuting-zone level. This is based on the fact that, according to the authors, robots and workers compete on the labor market and that robots potentially displace some of the human workforce (a phenomenon they call the displacement effect). The authors find sizable effects, namely that an increase of 1 robot per 1,000 workers from 1993 to 2007 recuded wages by nearly 1 percent and the employment-to-population ratio by nearly 0.39 percentage points, relative to a commuting-zone without robots. This means that one new robot decreases employment by 6 workers. 
But robotization does not only have negative effects. It leads to productivity increases and decreases in prices of those goods produced by robots [Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/19696). When taking account of these positive side effects, the overall effect of robotization is still negative but by much less. In this case one new robot decreases employment by 3.3 workers.  

So what about inequality? [Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020)](https://economics.mit.edu/files/19696) find that certain groups are more affected by robots than others. Specifically, effects are more marked for the manufacturing sector and those industries which concentrate a larger number of robots. Additionally, the effects are more pronounced for workers conducting routine manual jobs as well as blue-collar workers. The researchers also look at the effects by education group and find negative impacts on all workers, independently of their educations status. Still, when looking at the wage distribution, they show that those earning less than the average are the ones most affected by the wage decrease. The fact that robot adoption does not result in positive impacts for the high-skilled means that robots are not complementary to their tasks and increase their productivity (as is the case in other forms of technological change, as for example in the IT sector). 

On the contrary, research by [Feng an Graetz](https://academic-oup-com.emedien.ub.uni-muenchen.de/ej/article/130/631/2249/5831197) find that automation leads to job polarization. This means that low-skilled and high-skilled workers are unaffected by automation, and that it is the middle-skilled experiencing most of the negative impacts. Consequently, wages increase both in the low-wage employment as well as high-wage employment. They show that this is driven by firms' decision making. When confronted with two tasks that are equally automatable, firms tend to automate the one that requires more training over the one characterized by a higher engineering complexity. 


## Ex-Machina - And Evidence from Europe

<b><i>Europe. </i></b> Let's move away from the US and have a look at Europe. Similar to the US, researchers have become more and more interested in studying the effects of robots on local labor markets. In 2018, an analysis by [Chiacchio et al. (2018)](https://www.bruegel.org/2018/04/the-impact-of-industrial-robots-on-eu-employment-and-wages-a-local-labour-market-approach/) finds that, when looking at a total of 6 countries in the EU, one additional robot decreases the employment-to-population ratio by 0.16 to 0.20 percentage points. The young as well as middle-educated are the ones most affected by these negative employment effects, and the authors find no evidence on wage growth. The overall effects are significant but half of those observed in the US. This could be driven by different labor market policies and welfare systems. But they are not the ones who have studied the impact of robotization in the US. Evidence from different countries come to different conclusions, and I am going to summarize two of them for you in the following.

<b><i>Germany. </i></b> In Germany, the evidence points towards insignificant effects of robot adoption on local labor markets ([Dauth et al. (2021)](https://academic.oup.com/jeea/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jeea/jvab012/6179884)). While robotization has a negative impact on employment outcomes in the manufacturing sector, these job losses are compensated by job growth in the service sector. Within firms affected by robot technology, incumbent workers start to adapt their tasks and instead of leaving firms take over new tasks, which are more complex and of higher quality. In addition to that, those in jobs, which are complementary to the ones in which workers are replaced by robots (such as managers or technical scientists), benefit from robot adoption due to increased productivity. The researchers find negative effects on young workers who just join the labor market. But as the young adapt their educational choices and increasingly go to colleagues and universities, the impact is minimal. The overall effects on wages are insignificant but ambigous. While those staying with their employers, but switching to higher-qaulity tasks, face relatively large gains in earnings, those forced to switch firms face losses in their wages. What does that mean for inequality? Well, there are definitely losers and winners in the story of robotization. While those who manage to stay benefit from robot adoption, those who leave their firms experience losses. So inequality could rise among those responsible of the same tasks, but not among different skill-groups or along the wage distribution. Labour market institutions could be important to protect those at risks from the negative effcts of robot adoption. [Dauth et al. (2020)](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28322/w28322.pdf) find that the displacement effect of robots is larger in labor markets with lower labor market protection.

<b><i>France. </i></b> A recent paper conducting analysis using firm-level data from France comes to very different results than the ones found for the US. In contrast to Acemglu and Restrepo (2020) the authors of [What Are the Labor and Product Market Effects of Automation?New Evidence from France](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/aghion/files/what_are_the_labor_and_product_market_effects_of_automation_jan2020.pdf) find that automation leads to an increased labor demand, higher profits, lower consumer prices and higher sales. It therefore has an overall positive effect. Employment effects are even positive for unskilled industrial workers. This could be an indicator for the productivity effect (an increase in productivity driven by robotization) outweighting the displacement effect (robots substituting for workers) [Aghion et al (2020)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/aghion/files/what_are_the_labor_and_product_market_effects_of_automation_jan2020.pdf). Consequently, in a globalized world, in which robotization is unstoppable by now, it might be damaging to introduce protective mechanisms aiming at securing employment against robots. Firms placed in countries without those mechanisms might outperform those placed in protected economies through the induced productivity gains. Additionally, in the case of France, there are no significant effects of robot adoption on inequalitiy. 

## Wall-E - And Evidence from Japan 

<img src="/images/robots_japan.jpg" alt="robots_japan" style="float:right;margin: 2px 2px 2px 2px;max-width:23%;"/>

Asia has become a driving force behind the adoption of robotics worldwide. So how do the effects observed in Asian markets differ from the ones spotted in the US and EU? Research by [Eggleston et al. (2021)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w28322) looks at the effects of service sector robotics in Japan, using establishment-level data. To encounter some of the challenges induced due to Japan's aging population, the country has encouraged the implementation of service robots in nursing homes. These robots have led to an increase in the number of nurses in caring homes. Still, these new positions are marked by flexible and irregular employment contracts. Additionally, the researchers observe a wage decrease for regular nurses. This could be driven by an increase of part-time work (the reduction of hours worked). 

## Transformers - What about the developing world? 

The pioneer paper by [Graetz and Michaels (2018)](https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article/100/5/753/58489/Robots-at-Work) looks at robotization in different industries and 17 different countries from 1993 to 2007. They find that, overall, an increase in robot adoption leads to an increase in overall productivity as well as wages and a decrease in prices. Still, it has negative employment effects on the low-skilled.
